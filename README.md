# UBC-DBC-NWB
The jupyter notebook in this project allows saving data (raw and processed) collected from optical physiology experiments to a standardized NWB format; the notebook takes you through a step by step process on how to do so.

The assumption is that prior to running this notebook, you can an NWB file from running Suite2p with a .tif movie. You can then use this script to add relevant metadata about your recordings and analysis to the same NWB file.
