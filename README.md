# UBC-DBC-NWB
The jupyter notebook in this project allows saving metadata of optical physiology experiments in a standardized NWB format; this notebook takes you through a the process on how to do so and outlines what is happening at each step.

The assumption is that prior to running this notebook, you can an NWB file from running Suite2p with a .tif movie. You can then use this script to add relevant metadata about your recordings and analysis to the same NWB file.

Please note that the ophys.nwb file is the one we used to run the script with.
