    "# Converting Data To an NWB File Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script is meant to demonstrate how to convert data to an NWB file format (a more standardized way of storing raw and processed neuroscience data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script is based on the assumption that the following process has been followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Images have been recorded and scanned correctly with spatial calibration (with a two-photon microscope).\n",
    "\n",
    "The .tiff format files have then been imported and analyzed with suite2p which produces an NWB file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the NWB file created can now be loaded and its corresponding metadata can be added by following the script below.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to being able to do so, it is important to have Python 3.5+ installed on your computer.\n",
    "Once you have python installed, you can install PyNWB by copy/pasting either of the following commands onto your terminal. PyNWB is a python package with enables working with NWB files.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Loading in NWB File Created from Suite2p\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to add relevant metadata information about the NWB file created, you must read the file, add components, and then write back to the file. When loading in the nwb file, the mode constructor must be set to 'a' which indicates that we want to add relevant metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that you must include the file path in order to be able to successfully load in the nwb file.\n",
    "Example of sample file path: '/Users/sayeholoumi/Desktop/suite2p/ophys.nwb' if file ophys.nwb was stored in the suite2p folder on the Desktop.\n",
